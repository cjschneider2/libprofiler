	It should compile using :

	>cmake.
	>make


* HOW TO USE PROFILER LIBRARY :

	To compile the application you have to profile, use gcc 
	compiler option -finstrument-functions, that will add entry/exit
	function call to your program, calling both methods :
	
	extern "C"  void __cyg_profile_func_enter(void *func, void *callsite);
	extern "C" void __cyg_profile_func_exit(void *func, void *callsite);
	
	To launch profiled application you have to executes :

	LD_PRELOAD=[path to the library]/libprofiler.so [your program]

	i.e to launch a program "main" in the folder where the library
	is loaded :

	LD_PRELOAD=`pwd`/libprofiler.so main


* KEYS TO USE PROFILER LIBRARY :

	d -> change display mode, switch from list display, program output,
	     full list display, and graph and list display

	a -> sort by average time
	c -> sort by cpu time
	n -> sort by number of calls
	
	m -> select mode between list methods, and show longest path 

	left/right -> select thread
	up/down -> select line
